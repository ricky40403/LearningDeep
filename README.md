# Some Simple Deep Learning 

- Simple NN 
- RNN
- GAN

## Simple NN 

explore simple neural network and the difference between tanh and relu

## RNN

a simple learning calculater 

## GAN

2. Pikachu.ipynb : Learn to draw Pikachu (images from google)
May cause by the mess of the learning images, the pikachu learned by GAN change into different sahpes
